		<h3>DigitalCrafts BrewHouse Roasters & Farmers & Child Laborers</h3>
		<p>Digital Crafts BrewHouse is a boutique coffee shop founded in 2016 in Atlanta, Georgia.  Throughout our long 4-day storied history, we have clung to the belief coffee is what gives people the jitters. Due to caffeine's highly addictive nature, we felt coffee would be a great product to sell; cigarette's were already taken, and cocaine is illegal. As a result, our founding father William Bryant sought to create a company that would ship coffee to people on a weekly basis. He believes in making the world more addicted one cup of Joe at a time.</p>
		<p>DC Roasters is a boutique coffee shop that specializes in selling only the finest, most addictive, coffee on the planet. No matter how successful we may become we will always consider ourselves to be boutique street hustlers. Why you may ask? When someone thinks about a street-hustler, they associate them with attitude. Naturally, everyone will think our product tastes better because of it.</p>
		<p>It is with a deep sense of responsibility that we source our product and great care is taken in how we deliver it to you, our most valued money machine. Even though our coffee beans come from the same fields as much cheaper jet-fuel gas station coffee, it is our mission to make you percieve our's is far better than the competition. We accomplish this with sophisticated packaging and overpaying on designer labels, which gives you the conviction to pull out your wallet and purchase with great pride.</p>
